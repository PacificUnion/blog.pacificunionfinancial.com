<h2>Transferred Loans</h2>
<strong>Q: I sent my payment to my previous servicer. Will my payment be forwarded?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Yes, your previous servicer will automatically forward us any payments they receive within 60 days after your loan has been transferred. We will apply the payment to your account without a late fee. After 60 days, this service may no longer be provided and any payment sent to your prior servicer should be returned to you.
<br>
If you have questions about where to send your payments, contact us directly at 877-516-7998, Monday-Thursday 8:30am to 6:30pm and Friday 8:30am to 5:30pm CST.

<strong>Q: I just received a notice that my loan transferred, but I sent my most recent payment to Pacific Union. Will my payment be forwarded?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Yes. If your payment is received the business day before the effective date of transfer, Pacific Union will apply your mortgage payment.
<br>
If the payment is received after the effective date of transfer, your payment will be forwarded to the new servicer.
<br>
<strong>Q: I was set up on automatic payments with my previous servicer. Will that plan continue?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> No. Your automatic payments with the prior servicer will be discontinued on the date that your loan transfers. If you wish to enroll in the automatic payment service with Pacific Union, please visit the <a target="_blank" href="www.pacificunionfinancial.com/My-Account">My Account</a> section of our website, <a target="_blank" href="https://carenet.fnfismd.com/pacificunion/ACCLogin.jsp">log in to your account</a> and select the Automated Payments option to enroll.
<br>
<strong>Q: Will I be charged any late fees for delays during the transfer period?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> No. All payments received by your previous servicer during the 60 days following the date of transfer will be forwarded to Pacific Union and applied to your account. During the transfer period, you will not be charged a late fee, nor will you be reported to the national credit bureaus as past due.
<br>
<strong>Q: I have my tax and insurance payments issued through an escrow account. Will this continue after the transfer?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Yes. If you currently have an escrow account for the payment of your taxes and/or insurance premiums, Pacific Union will continue collecting these funds and making the payments on your behalf.
<br>
<strong>Q: Do I need to contact my insurance company about the transfer?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Your insurance company will be notified of your new servicer as a routine part of this transfer. However, we encourage you to confirm with your insurance carrier that the Insurance Mortgagee Clause has been updated.
<br>
<h2>Payments</h2>
<br>
<strong>Q: Do I have the option to make extra principal payments, and what is the benefit?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you have the option to make extra principal payments. Your loan must be current before an additional principal payment will be applied. By making additional monthly payments toward the principal you will shorten the length of the loan – and reduce its total cost – by saving on interest.
<br>
<strong>Q: How can I tell if my One-Time Payment was scheduled?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> A confirmation number is provided when the payment is processed with a customer service representative, paid by phone via our automated system or online. Pending payments may be reviewed online under the ‘one-time draft’ tab on the next business day that it was scheduled. Same day drafts will not display until the following business day.
<br>
<strong>Q: How can I cancel a pending payment?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Pending payments may be canceled by contacting us at 877-516-7998. Please note, we require a three (3) business day notice prior to a scheduled payment.
<br>
<strong>Q: If I make a payment today, when will it be applied to my account?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> A payment received before 11pm EST Monday through Friday, will be processed the same day. Any payments scheduled after 11pm EST, will be processed the next business day. 
<br>
<strong>Q: How can I make a change to my bank account information?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> You can make changes to your banking information when processing your online payment by selecting the Edit/Make Changes tab on the Banking Information page.   If the payment was processed over the phone with an agent or through the automated service, please contact our Customer Relations Department at 1-877-516-7998, Monday - Thursday 8:30 am - 6:30 pm and Friday 8:30 am - 5:30 pm CT.
<br>
<strong>Q: How long does it take for a scheduled transaction to complete and funds to be cleared/drawn from my bank account?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Your scheduled payment will be processed the same day. However, depending on your banking institution this may take 1 to 5 business days.
<br>
<strong>Q: How can I confirm that my payment has been received?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> You may sign up for the Notify Me option on our website when you log in to Manage Your Account. By selecting this option, an email confirmation will be sent to you every time a payment posts to your loan.
<br>
<strong>Q: How can I make an online payment?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Visit our website at <a target="_blank" href="www.pacificunionfinacial.com">www.pacificunionfinacial.com</a>.
If registered: Go to <a target="_blank" href="www.pacificunionfinacial.com/My-Account">My Account</a>, Log In to Account, Loan Servicing, One Time Draft and enter your payment account details.
If not registered: You must register first to make a one-time payment online.
<br>
<strong>Q: Can I make my payment with a credit card?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Our payment system is not currently setup to accept credit card payments.
<br>
<strong>Q: What bank account types may I use to pay using the One-Time Payment option?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> You may use a checking or savings account.
<br>
<strong>Q: What happens if my draft date falls on a Sunday or holiday?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> If the draft falls on a weekend/holiday, the payment will draft the following business day.
<br>
<strong>Q: What happens if I click ‘Submit’ more than once when I am making a mortgage payment? Will there be a duplicate payment?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> No, only one payment will draft. A duplicate payment will not be processed.
<br>
<strong>Q: When are my payments considered late?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Although payments are considered past due if not received by the due date, we offer a 15-day grace period to make your mortgage payment to avoid the late fee. If a payment is received after the 15th day grace period, a late fee will be assessed. If the payment is received after the end of the month, the information will be reported to the credit bureaus as a 30-day late payment.  To avoid the risk of damage to your credit or the assessment of a late charge, it is recommended that your payment be received by the due date.
<br>
<strong>Q: Is there a charge to make a payment online?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> There is no charge to process a payment online if the payment is made prior to the 5th of the month. After the 5th of the month, depending on the state requirements where the property is located, a one-time processing fee of $5.00 will be assessed.
<br>
<strong>Q: How do I let Pacific Union know I have a question about how my payment was applied?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> For payment inquiries, please contact our Customer Relations Department at 1-877-516-7998, Monday – Thursday, 8:30 am – 6:30 pm and Friday 8:30 am – 5:30 pm CT.  If you’re a registered online user, you may send us a secure message through the Contact Us tab.
<br>
<strong>Q: Why is there a delay in receiving my payments from my online banking service?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> The timeframe for receiving your payment from your bill pay service depends on the relationship with the payee. Pacific Union is set up to receive electronic payments with most large banks. Those payments are usually delivered in 1-2 business days. Some bill-pay services (typically smaller banks and credit unions) will issue paper checks to Pacific Union. Those payments are typically delivered by regular mail within 5-7 business days from the date you initiated the transaction.
<br>
<strong>Q: When I am processing my online bill payment and include a comment in the memo section, does Pacific Union receive this information?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Even though there may be a memo section on your home banking template, Pacific Union does not receive this information on electronic file transfers. If a check is sent to Pacific Union by your bank, the memo section may still not be available or may be incomplete.
<br>
<strong>Q: Can I set up a repeating payment from my bill pay service that will ensure funds are processed in accordance with my intentions?
</strong><strong>A:</strong>There are some limitations in receiving your payment application intentions when using bill pay services through your bank. We may be able to provide you more flexibility with your payment application by enrolling in Pacific Union Autopay. Please visit the Automatic Payments page of your online account to set up your program.
<br>
<h2>Pacific Union Autopay</h2>
<br>
<strong>Q: What are the benefits of signing up for Autopay?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Automatic payments will ensure a payment is received in a timely manner each month and will avoid possible late charges – and best of all, it’s free! You may select a date from the 1st -15th of the month.
<br>
Please note: If the payment draft date falls on a weekend or holiday the payment will be drafted on the next business day.
<br>
<strong>Q: How can I sign up for automatic payments?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> The easiest way is to sign up online:
<ol>
	<li><a target="_blank" href="www.pacificunionfinacial.com/My-Account">Sign in</a> to your account</li>
	<li>Click on Loan Servicing Center</li>
	<li>Click on Auto Draft Payment</li>
	<li>Enter their checking or savings account details</li>
	<li>Review the detailed confirmation page which includes the effective date and the amount that will draft.</li>
</ol>
This process may take 10-15 business days before the first draft date.
The Autopay must be set up 15 business days before the next payment due date or the Autopay will be postponed until the following month.
<br>
If you would like to have the application form mailed to you, please call Customer Service at 877-516-7998. Once the Autopay is set up, a confirmation notice will be mailed out to you.
<br>
<strong>Q: If I sign up today for automatic payments, do I need to make my payment for this month?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you still need to make your payment until you receive confirmation stating when your automatic drafts will begin.
<br>
<strong>Q: What happens if I do not have enough funds to cover my automatic payments?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> We require a three (3) business day notice prior to a scheduled draft to delete the Autopay.  If you’re a registered user via our website you may submit your deletion request through our website. However, you must delete the Autopay online 24 hours prior to the scheduled draft.
<br>
If payment will be returned for non-sufficient funds (NSF), we can process a one-time draft if funds are available now or set up a postdated check over the phone. Should we receive a second NSF notice, a certified stop will be placed on the account and the Autopay enrollment will be terminated.
