<h2>Loan and Life Changes</h2>
<strong>Q: I am divorced and not living in the home – am I still liable?
</strong><strong>A:</strong>Yes, if you signed the Note and Security Instrument (Mortgage or Deed of Trust), you are still liable for the payments. Most divorce agreements do not alter your obligation to make payments.

<strong>Q: I am in need of financial assistance – whom do I call?

<strong>Q: Do you offer a CEMA (Consolidation Extension and Modification Agreement)?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Yes, for more information please contact Customer Relations at 877-516-7998.

<strong>Q: If I have an ARM loan, when will I be notified of an upcoming payment change?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> ARM change notifications will be generated and mailed to you prior to the pending change. Based on the index in effect at that time, as stated in your Note, the resulting ARM change may produce an increase or decrease in your monthly payment amount. If the resulting change causes an increase in your payment amount that you believe will cause financial hardship, please call our Customer Relations Department at 1-877-516-7998 to discuss the options that may be available to you.
<h2>Terms and Definitions</h2>
<strong>Q: What is a loan assumption?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> An assumption occurs when another person not currently on the existing Note takes over responsibility for the loan exactly as it is. The term, interest rate, principal balance and monthly payments do not change. Payments are made without a lapse. The "new" borrower will be required to qualify for the loan. This involves a review of the credit report and employment and income verification. The process can up to 45 days to complete from the time a full assumption application is received.

<strong>Q: What is lender placed insurance?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> When adequate homeowner's insurance coverage has lapsed or we have been notified of a policy cancelation, we are required to obtain hazard insurance coverage on your behalf. Often this coverage is more expensive than the coverage you are able to purchase on your own. In addition, it only covers the structure. Your personal property is not included in such coverage.
<h2>Payment Activity</h2>
<strong>Q: Can I make a payment over the phone?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. Pacific Union Financial provides three options for our customers to make an automated one-time draft payment from their checking account. Payments can be made online or by phone, either using the automated phone system or by having a representative handle the payment. Please be advised that a processing fee may be charged to complete the transaction. Please contact our Customer Relations Department at 1-877-516-7998 to use either the automated phone system or to speak to a representative. The availability of this service may depend on payment status.

<strong>Q: Do I have a grace period?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Payments are considered past due if not received by the due date, but most loans have a period of time after that date for payments to be received and processed prior to a late charge being assessed. Please reference your Note or your monthly billing statement for the specific late fee amount associated with your loan.

<strong>Q: Do you offer an auto draft payment option?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Yes, our automatic payment program is a free service that will save you money on postage and eliminate the need to mail checks. To set up the automatic payment program online, click on the Auto-Draft Payment link from the Loan Servicing Tab.

<strong>Q: If I choose to pay through auto draft, does it have to be paid on my due date?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> No, you can select any day for your payment to be made monthly which is between the 1st through the 15th.

<strong>Q: If my payment is due on the 1st and I have a 15 day grace period, when will a late charge be assessed?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Most late charges are assessed after the close of business on the 16th of each month. If the 16th falls on a weekend or holiday, late charges are assessed after the close of business on the next business day. Refer to your Note to determine how many days you have between the due date and the late charge assessment date, not all loans allow for 15 days.

<strong>Q: Can I pay my monthly mortgage payment with a credit card?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> No, your monthly payment must be drafted from a savings or checking account.

<strong>Q: My payment is automatically deducted – if my payment changed do I need to do anything?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> No, the new payment amount will be automatically deducted from your account.

<strong>Q: When are my payments due?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Your monthly payment due date is established in your Note. Most Notes state a 1st of the month due date.

<strong>Q: Why did my payment change?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> An increase or decrease in your payment amount may be a result of an increase or decrease in your property taxes, annual insurance premium or a recent ARM adjustment. The increase or decrease in your taxes may be due to a property reassessment, a change in tax rate, a change in an exemption status or a special assessment.
<h2>Servicing</h2>
<strong>Q: Can I change my insurance company?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you have the ability to choose any homeowner's insurance carrier as long as it maintains either a B or better policyholder rating, or a 6 or better financial rating as published in the A. M. Best Company's Insurance report. If you do change your carrier, please notify us by sending a copy of your insurance declaration page to the address below. Also, be aware that some carriers may require a full year premium to be paid at time of the change.

<strong>Q: Can I pay my own insurance?

<strong>Q: Do I have to carry flood insurance on my home?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> If your property is within Flood Zone A or V, then federal law requires you to maintain and provide proof of flood coverage.

<strong>Q: Do I have to carry insurance on my home?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the terms of your loan require you to maintain adequate insurance coverage continuously. Adequate is defined as an amount equal to the remaining loan balance or the insurance value of your property, whichever is less.

<strong>Q: How can I delete Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Federal law gives you the right to request deletion of PMI once the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio reaches 80%. This may occur through normal payment activity or a larger principal reduction. Proof of value will be required. PMI deletion does require a good pay history. No payment may be 30 days late in the past 12 months and no payments may be more than 60 days past due in the last 24 months. Automatic PMI deletion will occur once your LTV reaches 78% through normal payment activity. In this instance, proof of value is not required. We are also required to follow the guidelines established by the investor of your loan. If you feel you qualify for PMI deletion based on the information above, please send a written request to our correspondence address.

<strong>Q: When will I receive my year end statement?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Mortgage Interest Statements, also known as Tax Form 1098, will be issued no later than January 31st of the following calendar year. Please contact our Customer Relations Department at 1-877-516-7998 if an additional copy is needed or click on the Year End Statement tab to print a copy.

<strong>Q: Why are late charges included on my Mortgage Interest Statement?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> The IRS has stated in Publication 936 that late charges paid must be shown as interest paid.

<strong>Q: Will I receive a coupon book?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> No, Pacific Union Financial, LLC issues monthly statements for your loan. Statements will be mailed to you immediately upon the receipt of any monthly payment or fee related activity.

<strong>Q: Will I receive notification that my payoff was received?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Yes, a notification letter stating that your loan has been paid in full will be mailed within 72 hours of our receiving your payoff funds. In addition, the Note and Security Instrument (Mortgage or Deed of Trust) to the property will be sent to you within the timeframe required by your state.
<h2>Escrow</h2>
<strong>Q: How long does it take to receive my escrow balance after my loan is paid in full?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> Once your loan is paid in full, the escrow/surplus balance, if any, will be refunded and sent to the mailing address within our system within approximately 20 business days from the date of the payoff transaction. If you are moving, it is important that you provide us a new mailing address to ensure receipt of any refund as a result of the payoff.

<strong>Q: If there is a shortage in my escrow account, what can I do?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> You may pay the shortage in your escrow account by mailing it to the address below. Make sure to write on the check and correspondence that the funds are for the escrow shortage. Upon receipt of your escrow shortage funds, we will adjust your payment to remove the shortage portion of your monthly installment. If you choose not to pay the shortage up front, the shortage will be spread over the next 12 payments, interest free. If the shortage causes a financial hardship and you feel that you cannot afford the increased payment amount, please call our Customer Relations Department at 877-516-7998 to discuss the options that may be available to you.

<strong>Q: Why did I receive an escrow overage check?
</strong><strong>A:</strong> An overage check can be a result of your annual insurance premium, taxes or both being less than originally expected. The escrow analysis statement included with the check should show how the overage was calculated. Federal law requires that we return any surplus over $50 directly to you. However, if you would like to return the overage check to us and have it applied as a principal reduction, please do so by endorsing the back of the check to Pacific Union Financial, LLC and send it to the address below.
